I am a second year master's student majoring in Computer Science at CU Boulder. I am a programmer and that pretty much explains everything: I have a broad interest in **ANY** programs that need to be built with `SQL`, `Java`, `C`, `C++`, `Python`, and `Scala`. Recently I am trying to write an Android app using Android Studio on my own to deepen my understanding of the various features that can be implemented in it (accessing external APIs, implementing sidebars, embellishing widgets, etc.).
