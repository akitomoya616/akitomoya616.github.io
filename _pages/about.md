I am a second year master's student majoring in Computer Science at CU Boulder. I am a programmer and that pretty much explains everything: I have a broad interest in **ANY** programs that need to be built with `SQL`, `Java`, `C`, `C++`, `Python`, and `Scala`. Recently I am trying to write an Android app using Android Studio on my own to deepen my understanding of the various features that can be implemented in it (accessing external APIs, implementing sidebars, embellishing widgets, etc.).

I was also minoring in Program of Rhetoric and Writing back in time as an undergraduate student. Please feel free to check out the [portfolio](https://ucb.digication.com/sitong-lu/home-1) I created as an undergraduate with a minor in writing, which is a collection of some of my best writing from my four years as an undergraduate, along with photos taken with various cell phones I owned!
