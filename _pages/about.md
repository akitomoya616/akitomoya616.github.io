I am a second year master's student majoring in *Computer Science* at University of Colorado Boulder. I am a programmer and that pretty much explains everything: I have a broad interest in **ANY** programs that need to be built with `SQL`, `Java`, `C`, `C++`, `Python`, and `Scala`. <span style="color:green">Recently I am trying to write an Android app using Android Studio on my own to deepen my understanding of the various features that can be implemented in it (accessing external APIs, implementing sidebars, embellishing widgets, etc.)</span>. In the past two years, I have mainly learned to develop 3D scenes using OpenGL, to create board game (and every single cell on the board is clickable for offering users with multiple functionalities) using Qt together with Pyside 6, to develop programs using object-oriented principles (implemented with various of design patterns, including Singleton pattern, Observer pattern, Factory pattern, Strategy pattern, Command pattern, etc.), and to build web pages hosted on Heroku with SQL databases and external API accessibility to display weather information.

I prefer <span style="color:blue">chatting with professors or with people older than me about something professional or academic, rather than talking to my peers about what I ate today, how was last night’s party, things like that</span>. When I say something professional or academic, I don't mean that they have to be non-entertainment things. I love watching anime and playing games for sure, but if I am talking to you about it, I prefer talking about it in details. For example, if I am talking about my favorite boss character from Dark Souls serious, I will cover background story of the boss, the design of its clothes, the lines it says, and the way it attacks the player, instead of just saying “I like this boss because it looks cool” and end it right there.


Outside of Computer Science
------
Besides programming, my hobbies include collecting and reviewing new phones from Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, Google, etc. I am also a big fan of the Souls games developed by From Software and Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3, and Bloodborne are my 3 favorite Souls games. In addition to the above two, I am also a Gundam fan and really enjoy delving into its related mechanical settings and story timeline (of the Universal Century).

In my spare time, I prefer staying at home (which is probably the ideal state of being as a programmer) and re-watching the Gundam anime from the 80s and 90s over and over again, while assembling some related plastic models (also known as Gunpla). I recently purchased an e-scooter, and it's one of the few times you'll see me outside - because I'll be riding around on it!

I was also minoring in Program of Rhetoric and Writing back in time as an undergraduate student. Please feel free to check out the [portfolio](https://ucb.digication.com/sitong-lu/home-1) I created as an undergraduate with a minor in writing, which is a collection of some of my best writing from my four years undergraduate studies, along with photos taken with various cell phones I owned!

Languages
------

I can speak and read the following 3 different languages:

- Chinese (native language)
- English
- Japanese (haven't taken JLPT yet, but I'm thinking of taking N3 test in December this year at Boulder.)
